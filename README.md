# epoll-shim

This is a small library that implements epoll on top of kqueue. It has been successfully used to port libinput,
libevdev, Wayland and more software to FreeBSD: <https://www.freshports.org/devel/libepoll-shim/>

It may be useful for porting other software that uses epoll as well.

There are some tests inside `test/`. They should also compile under Linux and can be used to verify proper epoll
behavior.

However, this library contains some very ugly hacks and workarounds. For example:

- When using `timerfd`, `signalfd` or `eventfd`, the system calls `read`,
  `write` and `close` are redefined as macros to internal helper functions. This is needed as there is some internal
  context that has to be free'd properly. This means that you shouldn't create a `timerfd`/`signalfd` in one part of a
  program and close it in a different part where
  `sys/timerfd.h` isn't included. The context would leak. Luckily, software such as libinput behaves very nicely and
  puts all `timerfd` related code in a single source file.

- There is limited support for file descriptors that lack support for kqueue but are supported by `poll(2)`. This
  includes graphics or sound devices under `/dev`. Those descriptors are handled in an outer `poll(2)`
  loop. Edge triggering using `EPOLLET` will not work.

- Shimmed file descriptors cannot be shared between processes. On `fork()`
  those fds are closed. When trying to pass a shimmed fd to another process the
  `sendmsg` call will return `EOPNOTSUPP`. In most cases sharing
  `epoll`/`timerfd`/`signalfd` is a bad idea anyway, but there are some legitimate use cases (for example sharing
  semaphore `eventfd`s, issue #23). When the OS natively supports `eventfd`s (as is the case for FreeBSD >= 13)
  this library won't provide `eventfd` shims or the `sys/eventfd.h` header.

- There is no proper notification mechanism for changes to the system
  `CLOCK_REALTIME` clock on BSD systems. Also, `kevent` `EVFILT_TIMER`s use the system monotonic clock as reference.
  Therefore, in order to implement absolute (`TFD_TIMER_ABSTIME`) `CLOCK_REALTIME` `timerfd`s or cancellation
  support (`TFD_TIMER_CANCEL_ON_SET`), a thread is spawned that periodically polls the system boot time for changes to
  the realtime clock.

The following operating systems are supported:

- FreeBSD >= 11.4, >= 12.2, >= 13.0
- NetBSD >= 9.1
- OpenBSD >= 6.7
- DragonFlyBSD >= 5.8.0

Be aware of some subtle kqueue bugs that may affect the emulated epoll behavior. I've marked tests that hit those
behaviors as "skipped". Have a look at `atf_tc_skip()` calls in the tests.

## Changelog

### 2021-04-18

- Fix compiler warning when using shimmed `fcntl`.

### 2021-04-17

- Allow setting `O_NONBLOCK` flag with `fcntl` on created file descriptors.
- Implement `TFD_TIMER_CANCEL_ON_SET` for `timerfd`.
- Implement correction of absolute (`TFD_TIMER_ABSTIME`) `CLOCK_REALTIME`
  `timerfd`s when the system time is stepped.

### 2021-03-22

- Fix compilation on FreeBSD < 12 (#28).

### 2021-03-21

- Add `O_CLOEXEC` handling to created file descriptors (PR #26, thanks arichardson!). Note that the shimmed file
  descriptors still won't work correctly after `exec(3)`. Therefore, *not* using
  `EPOLL_CLOEXEC`/`TFD_CLOEXEC`/`SFD_CLOEXEC`/`EFD_CLOEXEC` is strongly discouraged.

### 2021-03-10

- Fix compilation on FreeBSD 12.1 (#25).

### 2021-02-13

- `signalfd` now hooks into the signal disposition mechanism, just like on Linux. Note: `poll` and `ppoll` are also
  shimmed with macros in case
  `sys/signalfd.h` is included to support some use cases seen in the wild. Many more `ssi_*` fields are now set on the
  resulting `struct signalfd_siginfo`.
- More accurate timeout calculations for `epoll_wait`/`poll`/`ppoll`.
- Fix integer overflow on timerfd timeout field on 32-bit machines.
- Fix re-arming of timerfd timeouts on BSDs where EV_ADD of a EVFILT_TIMER doesn't do it.

### 2020-12-29

- Add support for native `eventfd`s (provided by FreeBSD >= 13). The
  `sys/eventfd.h` header will not be installed in this case.

### 2020-11-06

- Add support for NetBSD 9.1.

### 2020-06-02

- On FreeBSD, add missing `sys/signal.h` include that resulted in `sigset_t`
  errors (#21).

### 2020-04-25

- Lift limit of 32 descriptors in `epoll_wait(2)`.
- Implement `EPOLLPRI` using `EVFILT_EXCEPT`, if available. If it is not available, add logic to `EVFILT_READ` handling
  that will work if
  `SO_OOBINLINE` is set on the socket.
- Implement `EPOLLONESHOT`.
- Implement edge triggering with `EPOLLET`.
- Add support for unlimited numbers of poll-only fds per epoll instance.
- Merge `EVFILT_READ`/`EVFILT_WRITE` events together to more closely match epoll semantics.
- Add support for NetBSD, OpenBSD and DragonFlyBSD.

### 2020-04-08

- Implement `epoll_pwait(2)`.
